### Hi, I’m Paul!

I’m a full-stack engineer and algorithmic trader. I work primarily with Python, PostgreSQL, React, and TypeScript, building data-driven systems focused on correctness, performance, scalability, testability, and long-term maintainability. My interests include backend architecture, historical and real-time data processing, APIs, automation, and analytical pipelines for financial markets, with a strong focus on clean, precise, and well-designed user interfaces. Alongside engineering, I focus on daily trading, market data analysis, and algorithmic decision-making. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, art, photography, and travel.
