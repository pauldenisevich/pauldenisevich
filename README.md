Hi, I am Paul — a full stack engineer and algorithmic trader. I work primarily with Python, PostgreSQL, PHP, React, and TypeScript, building data-driven systems focused on correctness, performance, and long-term maintainability. My interests span backend architecture, real-time data processing, APIs, automation, and analytical pipelines for financial markets.

Alongside engineering, I focus on systematic trading, market data analysis, and algorithmic decision-making. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, art, photography, and travel.
